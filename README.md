# The extension to support GraphQl queries

It provides the QueryByPrototype request, and marshaller to transpose
such request into GraphQL syntax.

The query-by-prototype approach allows to convert a Gm-based
description into a GraphQL query and make the representation of the
result as Gm-entities very easy.
However, the simplicity of the approach limits the resulting queries to
basic statements.
